          HS Prannoy advanced to the quarter-finals of the men's singles event
          at the BWF World Badminton Championships 2023 in Copenhagen, Denmark
          on Thursday but compatriot Lakshya Sen bowed out. World No. 9 HS
          Prannoy overcame Singapore’s Loh Kean Yew, the world No. 7 and the
          2021 world champion, 21-18, 15-21, 21-19 in a 69-minute marathon in
          the round of 16 match. The decider was a closely-fought affair and
          both players were tied at 19-all before the HS Prannoy came up trumps
          under pressure. This was the Indian shuttler’s fourth win over Loh
          Kean Yew in five meetings. The intense contest saw both players leave
          it all on the court. “My physio has some work tonight to get me ready
          for tomorrow,” HS Prannoy said. “But I have been able to play
          back-to-back good matches. That’s been a positive change in the last
          few years. My body has been able to keep up.” Lakshya Sen, seeded
          11th, however, came up short in a three-game affair against Thailand’s
          Kunalvut Vitidsarn, the world No. 3. The Indian badminton player lost
          the match 14-21, 21-16, 13-21 in 68 minutes. Lakshya Sen, a former
          world championships bronze medallist, lost the opening game but was
          able to force the match into a decider. The reigning Commonwealth
          Games champion from India went toe-to-toe against Vitidsarn in the
          opening exchanges before the Thai shuttler won four straight points to
          take a 13-9 lead. Lakshya, playing catch up, never recovered and
          slumped to a defeat. In the men’s doubles, India’s Chirag Shetty and
          Satwiksairaj Rankireddy fell behind but fought back to beat
          Indonesia’s Leo Rolly Carnando and Daniel Marthin 15-21, 21-19, 9-21.
          India’s women’s doubles campaign, meanwhile, wrapped up after Treesa
          Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost 21-14, 21-9 to the People’s Republic
          of China’s Chen Qing Chen and Jia Yi Fan. The top-seeded Chinese duo
          are three-time world champions and Tokyo Olympics silver medallists.
